# PockemonChase
Project Overview: 
This is a 3D chasing game mainly implemented with JavaScript WebGL API. A Pokemon is chased by a car. The Pokemon is moving at a random start speed to a random direction, and you can control your car to chase it. If you successfully hit(collide with) it, then you win. A car can be controlled using UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys. Pressing LEFT and RIGHT keys can turn the car. Trees are obstacles for your car, but not for Pokemon. You can press Q,E to world up and world down the camera. Everything has a shadow and Phong-Blinn  shading. You can not move your car up and down (Y direction).
